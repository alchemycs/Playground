<h1>Playground</h1>
<p>
Just some stuff to play around with. Let's me peek and poke some of
the nicer stuff in web life like canvas etc...
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="life/index.html">Life with canvas</a></dt>
  <dd>A javascript implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_new">Conway's Game of Life</a> using the
    canvas element
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="FiveBoxRiskMatrix/index.html">Five Box Risk Matrix</a></dt>
  <dd>A simple proof of concept to help with determining a <a href="http://www.scu.edu.au/risk_management/index.php/5/" target="_new">risk rating</a> in a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance,_risk_management,_and_compliance" targe="_new">Governance, Risk and Compliance</a> context.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="transforms/index.html">Rotational Transform</a></dt>
  <dd>My son has some homework on rotational transforms, but the
    examples are showing a 360&deg; transform as looking like a
    90&deg; transform. I made this so he can explore it for himself
    and see what transforms really look like.
