README
======

This project isn't a project as such, just a place to try out some
very basic stuff and keep it as a reference.

Canvas
------
Yeah, `canvas` has been around for a while, but I have never had the
chance to use it. Thought I would give it a go by implementing that
'ol favourite, [Conway's Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

I wrote it years ago on my C=64 in BASIC using `peek` and `poke`
directly to the screen memory...ahhh...memories...

So now here is a pretty basic version written in Javascript for the
`canvas` element. So simple, but it made me feel all warm and fuzzy
inside with my memories harkening back to a more innocent time when I
coded for fun and not for profit....

Five Box Risk Matrix
--------------------
GRC systems always have these lovely boxes with colours that you
are expected to use to rate your risks. Most of the systems I have
seen are pretty crap, so thought I would just whack this proof of
concept together for making something a little more palatable.
